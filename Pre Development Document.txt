This is the text document where we list the things we want to include into our program and give detailed information about what we want the program to do.


Visualized Product:
When you first open the program you are met with a searchbox of the various supported currencies. You can then select one or multiple.
if you select one you can always select more later or delete some from your list. 
Each currency has a "brief view" showing the latest statistics, which can be expanded into a more detailed version.

You can toggle desktop notifications about the value going up or down a certain amount in a given time. it would notify you if the current price is 
within 5% of the 24-hour high or low so you can watch to buy/sell.
